    <p>The field of Electronics and Telecommunications occupies a unique position in the area of Technologies, which was nurtured by some of the best minds of this century, one that has witnessed highest rate of obsolescence. This department has the opportunities to adapt its curricula, laboratories and research programs to stay abreast of all the developments in electronics and related areas. In all its programs, it has managed to acquire the right mix of computers and communication, which is what, is fuelling the explosive growth in the era of electronics today.

Telecommunication is an area of specialization within the field of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering. It is concerned with all aspects of theory and applications for a broad range of systems such as telephone and data networks, radio and television broadcasting, satellite and deep space applications.

The study of Telecommunication may also involve research in digital communications, microwaves and antennas, optical communications (including the design and manufacture of lasers and optical fibers), signal and information processing and satellite mobile communications.

The ETE curriculum provides a wide perspective of the field of electronics and allows the student to decide his future directions. As can be expected, the students often diverge into related fields such as computer engineering. The ETE branch provides the perfect ground and flexibility for the students who wish to go into other streams

The field of telecommunication in Bangladesh is growing day by day. The students of ETE have ample opportunities to work in different telecom operators, Vendors in Bangladesh as  in well as sub-continent countries. After completion of graduation, the students will achieve practical knowledge about how to do Network Planning, Radio Planning, Control and Maintenance of BTS and BSC and the Switching system of Mobile Switching Centers.

 <p>Computer science is the study of computation, information, and automation.[1][2][3] Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).[4][5][6] Though more often considered an academic discipline, computer science is closely related to computer programming.[7]

Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.[8] The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Humanâ€“computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.

The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.[2][9][3][10][11] The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.[12][13]</p></details>

   <p>Electrical engineering (sometimes referred to as electrical and electronic engineering) is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century with the commercialization of the electric telegraph and electrical power supply. The field now covers a range of sub-disciplines including those that deal with power, optoelectronics, digital electronics, analog electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, control systems, electronics, signal processing and telecommunications.

The term electrical engineering may or may not encompass electronic engineering. Where a distinction is made, electrical engineering is considered to deal with the problems associated with large-scale electrical systems such as power transmission and motor control, whereas electronic engineering deals with the study of small-scale electronic systems including computers and integrated circuits. Another way of looking at the distinction is that electrical engineers are usually concerned with using electricity to transmit energy, while electronics engineers are concerned with using electricity to transmit information.</p></details>
